# Overview

This repo will contain custom toy problems that either I've made up on my own, or have taken strong inspiration from others and refined them.

## Problems

1. [Circle Problem](https://github.com/Unobtainiumrock/circle-problem/tree/master/circle-toy-problem): This one took inspiration from the YouTuber [AiFlux](https://www.youtube.com/user/aiflux) where in one of his videos he gave the question to an LLM he was evaluating. I expanded upon the idea and further refined the problem statement.
